## 🧱 About Me

I’m an independent coder, fabricator, and systems designer focused on bridging the gap between **physical industries and digital infrastructure**.

My work explores how automation, data integrity, and decentralized design systems can reshape fabrication, manufacturing, and construction workflows.

Currently operating under **Cindr Labs LLC**, an R&D studio developing real tools and frameworks that make complex processes **usable, auditable, and resilient**.

## 🧩 Cindr Labs (Stealth Mode)

Cindr Labs is developing next generation systems for fabrication and construction where **design meets data**.  
We’re in **stealth mode** while finalizing our IP and validating live deployments with industry partners.

🔒 Technical documentation is withheld pending patent filing.  
🧠 Infrastructure built with deterministic, compliant, and scalable principles.
